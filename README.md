# :seedling: openair-violet :seedling:

This repo is dedicated to the **openair-violet**, the world's first open hardware *Direct Air Carbon Capture* ***(DACC)*** *Machine* :cactus: .

We are working off of the designs provided by ***`Dr Tao Wang`*** to produce the first designs for the **OpenAir Violet**.

This is *very much* a work in progress, below is the current diagram of what we are putting together.

# What is this Project?

OpenAir Violet is an `open-source direct air carbon capture`, or `DACC`, prototype machine, and is just one of the OpenAir Collectiveâ€™s Research & Development (R&D) projects. Inspired by the research of `Prof. Tao Wang` at `Zhejiang University`, Violet collects atmospheric CO2 by passing ambient air through a sorbent membrane material. The carbon is then captured and released from the sorbent using [Moisture Swing Technology](https://docs.google.com/document/d/15x6pYi-xJytPkurglT9BauONpkMiZNfhfKL4CRyjoe4/edit?usp=sharing).

## Where We are Going

The Violet project has near-term and long-term goals. `The ultimate goal of the Violet mission is to create a modular, small-scale DACC machine that is affordable, buildable, and distributable`. Empowering individuals to participate in carbon dioxide removal `CDR` technology.

**Current Goals**:

- Develop an affordable (*less than $2,000 per unit*) and ***DIY-buildable*** version of `Violet`
- Optimize the *moisture swing* sorbent compound to obtain ***1 kg/day CO2*** capture rate
- Facilitate `open-source collaboration` and share R&D ideas for continued development

**Future Goals**:

- Discover new applications for Violet and DACC technology
- Distribute Violet technology to individuals looking to contribute to it and advance it
- Solve key cost and technology barriers to widespread DACC implementation

## How to get involved?

Check out the [Materials](#list-of-materials) section to see what is required to get started building your own!

PCB's can be ordered from `JLCPCB` or `PCBWay`, or *made yourself*. The PCB files are still in prototype phase and we welcome any development ideas.
